          <p><b>Our llamas</b> are the most majestic llamas any person can ask for! We breed our llamas to perfection so that they are perfect in every aspect and can easily adapt to the enviroment they will be placed in. We don't want any defective llamas ruining the tranquil enviroment for our customers during their llama experiences.</p>
          <p><b>Our llamas</b> require substantial care, so we make sure they are placed in the most hospitable enviroment we can provide in order to improve their mood and condition. Most of our llama are equipped with tracking devices so if they manage to get flee from the farm we can easily find them.</p>
          <p><b>Our llamas</b> have the most pristine fur in marvelous condition. We constantly groom our llamas so they can have an exceedingly spectacular appearance. Once your eyes gaze upon these brilliant llamas you can never avert your attention from them.</p> 
          <h3>Defective Llamas?</h3>
          <p>We don't want any llamas to ruin our customers' tranquil experiences at the farm, so if one becomes a nuisance or, in a more general term, is "not perfect", we simply slaughter it! We even have engineers manufacture bionic llamas from the remaining llama corpses so that those deceased llamas don't go to waste even after death! Many would argue that our actions are inhumane, but we simply respond, "Look at it in perspective. It would be a pain to have imperfect llamas terrorizing your customers to no end. Therefore, we believe that it is most reasonable and best for everyone if we eliminate any inferior threats, so we don't run the risk of any imperfections ruining the true llama experience."  </p>
