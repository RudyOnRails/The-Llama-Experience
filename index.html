                <p> Welcome to the Llama Experience website. We're a nonprofit, unorganized, single person just messing around, so don't take anything literally. This website was created for testing purposes. Much of the information provided in this website is false, but perhaps part of it is true. We <strong>DO NOT</strong> claim ownership for any images, businesses, or URL's you may be redirected to. Nevertheless, welcome and thank you for visiting. We have been inspired to do this ever since we realized the true glory of llamas. Llamas, and taking care of llamas, has forever been our passion. As a result, we believe it is fair to share these magnificent experiences with other people.
